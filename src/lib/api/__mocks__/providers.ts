      bio: 'From a young age I have been interested in promoting health and wellness and followed my passion into a career in healthcare. I received my Master of Physician Assistant Studies from the University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus in 2010. After graduation, I was selected as a National Health Service Corp Scholar and spent two years serving in a rural underserved community. This experience gave me a strong foundation in treating patients of all ages in outpatient and inpatient settings, but while living in a small community, I realized that I was still a city girl at heart. In 2012 I relocated back to Denver and have been practicing in the Denver metro area ever since.\r\nThrough practicing in family medicine, I have realized how much our mental health effects our well-being and found that my true passion is in promoting mental health wellness. I have a special interest in gut health and how our gut microbiome impacts not only our mental health, but our overall wellness. I believe in an integrated approach to behavioral health care that includes nutrition, exercise, meditation, and sleep education. My goal is to collaborate with each patient to form an individualized approach to care.\r\nIn my spare time, I am an avid runner and have completed multiple marathons including the world-famous Boston Marathon. On the weekends I enjoy taking my love of running to the trails and when I am not outside enjoying Colorado’s sunshine, you can find me in the kitchen trying new recipes and finding ways to incorporate more plants into my diet.\r\nI look forward to partnering with you on your healthcare journey!',

      bio: 'I’m Lauren (she/her) and I am a trained art therapist with nine years of experience working in mental health settings. I recently received my Masters in Clinical Mental Health Counseling, concentrating in Transpersonal Art Therapy. Art therapy doesn’t require you to be experienced or “good” at making art. Working with an art therapist involves using art materials to access the subconscious and help you find meaning in your creative choices that relate to your life. It can also serve as a regulating tool when discussing challenging material. Overall, art therapy can help you understand yourself in a way that differs from traditional talk therapies.\nWe can use art therapy in our time together, or not! It’s up to you! I primarily use a Client-Centered approach, which is grounded in the idea that you own your potential for healing and the importance of co-collaboration between the therapist and client. In other words, you have a voice in your therapeutic journey, and I am here to support you without judgment.\r\nMy own artist identity allows me to be curious and creative in developing an integral individualized approach structured for you based on your own goals and strengths while anchored in relevant research. I also believe in cultivating long-term coping strategies to last beyond your time in therapy. Due to my contemplative education, I am also trained in meditation; this helps me stay present with you and integrate mindfulness-based approaches into our work together. In addition, somatic and expressive therapies guide me in assessing and incorporating movement into my therapeutic practices. If you are a creative individual who is open to trying something different, I’m your gal.\r\nMy experience includes residential and inpatient treatment settings, community-based work, clinical research, non-profits, and school settings. I am passionate about working with creative individuals and can work with children, adolescents, and adults who struggle with sensory processing challenges, disordered eating, adjustment challenges, and childhood trauma. I am social justice-oriented, LGBTQIA+ allied, and value cultural humility.\r\nIf it feels like a good fit for you, I am so excited to get to know you and support you on your journey!\r\n',
